# Contributing to Snap Tutorials

Folder structure how-to:

* Create a new folder for your tutorial
* Create a README.md in that folder
* If the tutorial is simple enough to fit into a single markdown file, use the README.md as your post. See example in `introduction-task-manifest`
* If the tutorial is best separated out into parts, create multiple sections as separate files. See `example-complex/` for an example of how this looks in practice

Tips for a great tutorial:

* When animation is better than words, make gifs with [licecap][1]!
