# Snap Labs
A curated set of guides to using Snap, the open telemetry framework

### What are these?

* Thorough, step-by-step guides for using Snap and its plugins
* Organized, to the best of our ability, by level of familiarity with a feature or complexity of dependencies

### Where should I start?

We aim to have introductions to each major feature and label them as `introduction-<feature>`. More advanced topics are titled `advanced-<feature>`. You get the idea. Labs that do not smoothly fall into one of these categories will be called `topic-<topic>`. Examples would be:

* `introduction-distributed-workflow` or `introduction-snmp-plugin`
* `advanced-graphite-plugin` or `advanced-distributed-workflow`
* `topic-normalizing-data` or `topic-monitoring-kubernetes`

### Where else should I look to learn about Snap?

Every plugin has working examples including Task Manifests and required configuration files. So if you know you want to learn the basics of a plugin, like the Graphite publisher for example, go directly to its example in the README (ex. [Graphite example section](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-publisher-graphite#examples)). We also have drafts of future posts on the `drafts` branch. 

### Can I contribute?

You bet! An overview of how we organize these labs is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
